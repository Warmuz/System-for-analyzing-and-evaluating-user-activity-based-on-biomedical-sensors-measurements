The project aims to develop an application that gathers heart rate (HR) data on the examined athlete by Optical Heart Rate Monitors (OHRM) like smartwatches and quantifies training load by TRaining IMPulse (TRIMP) approach. Collected TRIMP information is sufficient to assess the actual state of performance by the Banister model. The thesis also focuses on tuning the Banister model by efficiency tests to get a more precise assessment of the actual performance state. The final look of the application is clear and presents the most important details like training history by TRIMP bar plot and performance history by plot in ten days in advance to prevent overtraining syndrome.
